### Assignment: dcgan
#### Date: Deadline: Jun 30, 23:59
#### Points: 1 points
#### Tests: dcgan_tests

This task is a continuation of the `gan` assignment, which you will modify to
implement the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN).

Start with the
[dcgan.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/past-2122/labs/12/dcgan.py)
template and implement a DCGAN. Note that most of the TODO notes are from
the `gan` assignment.

After submitting the assignment to ReCodEx, you can experiment with the three
available datasets (`mnist`, `mnist-fashion`, and `mnist-cifarcars`). However,
note that you will need a lot of computational power (preferably a GPU) to
generate the images; the example outputs below were also generated on a GPU,
which means the results are nondeterministic. The images generated by the
reference solution can be watched
[here](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/courses/npfl114/2122/demos/dcgan.html).

#### Tests Start: dcgan_tests
_Note that your results may be slightly different, depending on your CPU type and whether you use a GPU._
